# form-validation
A Javascript project that focuses on validating form before sending it to php file

This is the first version of code that validate below things:

1)Check username is empty 
2)Check valid email have one @ not a lot or none also check email has at lease 3 letter at start
3)Validate the password : have 8 letter ? at lease have one Upper and lower case letters ? have at leaset one number ? and have a special letters?
4)Confirm password that should be same with password
5)day month and year that should be correct like day between 1 and 31 or month 1 and 12 or year between 1900 => 2022

for later updates I,ll add more complex password like how strong is.
more complex birth date like handeling errors.

Hope you liked that ;)
